# Example Whow Configuration
# This works like a normal shell script, so quote anything with space, and use backslash to prevent expansion (or use single quotes).

## Options

# Enable icons (could be emojis)
icons yes

# Directory for the to-do's and events
cachedir "$HOME/.config/whow/"

# Time format for writing to-do's, schedules, and printing in a pretty format
# Can be set to 12[h] (AM/PM) or 24[h].
# Example of writing in 12h format: 01:12 PM
# And in 24h format: 13:12
timeformat 12

# Date format for printing (you might want it to be more human-readable)
# Check the format at date(1) manual page or run `info date` if you have texinfo installed.
# The format below is the default and will print something like "Sun, 20 April 2022".
dateformat "%a, %b %d %Y"

# Date format for writing, below is the default.
# Can be mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy, dd/mm, or mm/dd. 
dateformat_cfg "mm/dd/yyyy"

# Categories
# This can also be used for some other stuff like priority.
# Note: A builtin category called "important" will be added by default.

#category "art" "programming" "asap" "fun"
# You can also assign colors to them (only works with 256 colors/true color capable terminal):
category "art:blue" "programming:yellow" "asap:red" "fun:purple" "school:pink"
# Available colors are (d is suffix for dark and l for light):
# green, blue, yellow, red, orange, brown, dgreen, dblue, lblue, dred, pink, purple


## Formatting

# Available sections:
# date, separator:n, calendar, todos, events, important, custom:n

# Separator 1 looks like this:
# ———————————————————————
#
# 2 looks like this:
# =======================
#
# 3 looks like this:
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# and 0 will just print a new line.

format "separator:1" "date" "separator:1" "calendar" "separator:2" "important" "todos" "separator:2" "events" "separator:2"
# For the custom section, define your own in this file (doesn't matter where), or source it from other file

# Here's an example (this will be custom:1):
#custom 1 '
#echo "Host: $(hostname)"
#echo "Uptime: $(uptime --pretty)"
#curl "https://random-link/script.sh" | bash -
#'

# Another one with only one command:
#custom 1 afetch

# Also, you can assign a string instead to a custom section key so custom:weather would work too.


# vim: ft=sh
